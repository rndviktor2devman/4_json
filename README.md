# 4_json

Run script: type ' python3.5 pprint_json.py "path_to_json_file" '
Neccessary parameter - path to json file with some dataset. Without it exception will be thrown.

Script simply loads json data and prints it nicely(every node will have speciefic indent, 2 in our case),
which is more easy to read than plain text.
